Hi, I am a passionate developer with an interest in frontend development, and I also create APIs with Express and Flask when required. But what I really love doing is, if necessary, complicating things to make a simple button appealing to users. Apart from writing code, I enjoy breaking down complex issues into simpler steps and conveying them to others in layman's terms. I am also customer-obsessed and ensure that clients understand what's going on, striving to find solutions to problems they present.

## I've built these <u><a href="https://badri119.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank">projects</a></u> for fun and enjoy building full-stack applications that serve a purpose!

When I'm not working, I love biking, as shown in the picture above. I also aim to start racing soon, once I'm in better shape and confident my legs can break the pedals ðŸ˜†

## Wanna know something cool?

### In May 2023, I began cycling, and within three months, I rode all the way from North Vancouver to Mount Baker and back, all in one day. Would I endure the discomfort again? Absolutely!
