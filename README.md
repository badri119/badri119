Hi, I am a passionate developer with an interest in frontend development, and I also create APIs with Express and Flask when required. But what I really love doing is, if necessary, complicating things to make a simple button appealing to users. Apart from writing code, I enjoy breaking down complex issues into simpler steps and conveying them to others in layman's terms. I am also customer-obsessed and ensure that clients understand what's going on, striving to find solutions to problems they present.

Off work, I enjoy riding my bike, as you can see from the picture above, and I plan on racing soon once I am fit and believe my legs can last longer to hammer the pedals.

## Wanna know something cool?

### In May 2023, I began cycling, and within three months, I rode all the way from North Vancouver to Mount Baker and back, all in one day. Would I endure the discomfort again? Absolutely!
